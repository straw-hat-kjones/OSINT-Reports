# Sliver C2 Framework: Comprehensive Threat Intelligence Report

## Executive Summary

[[Malware/Sliver C2]] has emerged as the command-and-control framework of choice for ransomware operators and nation-state actors seeking to evade detection. This open-source, cross-platform C2 framework developed by Bishop Fox has been adopted by [[Threat Actors/APT29]] (Russian SVR), Chinese-linked [[Threat Actors/UNC5266]], North Korean [[Threat Actors/Jumpy Pisces]], and multiple ransomware affiliates including [[Threat Actors/FIN12]], [[Threat Actors/ShadowSyndicate]], and [[Threat Actors/Fog Ransomware]] operators.

Originally designed for red team operations, Sliver's **free availability, lower detection rates, and Cobalt Strike-equivalent capabilities** have driven rapid threat actor adoption since 2020. CISA, the UK NCSC, and major security vendors now track Sliver as a significant threat requiring dedicated detection strategies.

**Key Findings:**
- Nation-state actors from Russia, China, and North Korea have adopted Sliver C2
- At least 7 ransomware families have been deployed using Sliver as the C2 infrastructure
- Default configurations create detectable patterns via JARM fingerprinting and service creation
- Version 1.6 introduced JARM randomization, requiring behavioral detection approaches

---

## Key Points

- **Rising Cobalt Strike Alternative**: Sliver adoption increased significantly after defenders improved Cobalt Strike detection; threat actors cite zero licensing cost and lower detection rates
- **Cross-Platform Capability**: Native support for Windows, Linux, and macOS without runtime dependencies enables attacks across diverse environments
- **Multiple C2 Protocols**: Supports mTLS (TCP/8888), WireGuard (UDP/51820), HTTP/HTTPS, and DNS tunneling for operational flexibility
- **Dynamic Compilation**: Per-binary asymmetric key generation prevents hash-based detection and complicates attribution
- **Ransomware Nexus**: ShadowSyndicate alone has deployed 7 ransomware families using Sliver infrastructure

---

## Technical Architecture

### Framework Components

Sliver operates on a client-server model written entirely in Go (Golang), providing native cross-platform support without runtime dependencies. The architecture consists of:

| Component | Description | Default Port |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **sliver-server** | Core server process with SQLite database | TCP/31337 (gRPC) |
| **sliver-client** | Operator interface using mTLS authentication | N/A |
| **Implants** | Session or Beacon mode payloads | Protocol-dependent |

### Communication Protocols

| Protocol | Port | Use Case | Detection Difficulty |
|----------|------|----------|---------------------|
| **mTLS** | TCP/8888 | Strongest authentication, bidirectional X.509 | Medium |
| **WireGuard** | UDP/51820 | VPN tunneling, data exfiltration | High |
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | 80/443 | Traffic blending, customizable profiles | Medium-High |
| **DNS** | 53 | Restrictive networks, slow throughput | High |

### Implant Modes

**Session Mode**: Persistent real-time connections with heartbeat packets every few seconds. Required for interactive operations including SOCKS5 proxying, port forwarding, and live shell access.

**Beacon Mode**: Asynchronous check-ins at configurable intervals (seconds to days) with jitter randomization. Significantly reduces behavioral detection. Operators can convert beacons to sessions on-demand using the `interactive` command.

### Evasion Capabilities

- **Process Injection (T1055)**: `VirtualAllocEx` → `WriteProcessMemory` → `VirtualProtectEx` → `CreateRemoteThread` chain
- **Default Injection Target**: notepad.exe (migrate), spoolsv.exe (getsystem)
- **Obfuscation**: garble library for symbol obfuscation, Shikata ga nai for shellcode
- **Dynamic Compilation**: Unique curve25519 keys per implant, preventing hash-based detection

## Threat Actor Adoption

### Nation-State Actors

#### APT29/Cozy Bear (Russian SVR)

APT29 pivoted to Sliver in October 2020 following exposure of their WellMess and WellMail capabilities. The UK NCSC noted this represented "an attempt to ensure access to existing victims was maintained following the exposure of those capabilities." Deployed separate C2 infrastructure for each compromised victim across 21 Fortune 500 organizations.

#### UNC5266 (Chinese-Linked)

Deployed Sliver following exploitation of Ivanti Connect Secure vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887) in early 2024. Placed implants masquerading as legitimate system files with modified systemd services for persistence.

#### Jumpy Pisces (North Korean)

Used Sliver C2 in collaboration with Play ransomware operators—the **first documented collaboration between North Korean state actors and underground ransomware networks**. C2 communications observed until the day before ransomware deployment.

### Ransomware Operators

| Threat Actor | Ransomware Families | Delivery Method |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **FIN12/DEV-0237** | Ryuk, Conti, Hive, BlackCat | BazarLoader, TrickBot, Bumblebee |
| **ShadowSyndicate** | Quantum, Nokoyawa, ALPHV, Royal, Cl0p, Play, Cactus | 85 servers with common SSH fingerprint |
| **Fog Ransomware** | Fog | SonicWall VPN exploitation |

ShadowSyndicate, identified by Group-IB in September 2023, operates as a RaaS affiliate using Sliver alongside [[Malware/Cobalt Strike]] across seven ransomware families. Infrastructure spans 85 servers sharing a common SSH fingerprint.

### Adoption Drivers

As Team Cymru noted: *"Sliver has a lot of the same capabilities as Cobalt Strike, but without such a large spotlight being shone on it."* Key factors include:
- Zero licensing cost (vs. Cobalt Strike commercial licensing)
- Full source code availability enabling customization
- No watermarking that can tie cracked Cobalt Strike to specific compromises
- Lower detection rates due to reduced security industry focus

## Detection Opportunities

### Network-Based Detection

#### JARM Fingerprints

| Protocol | JARM Hash | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **HTTPS** | `3fd21b20d00000021c43d21b21b43d41226dd5dfc615dd4a96265559485910` | Default HTTPS listener |
| **mTLS** | `00000000000000000043d43d00043de2a97eabb398317329f027c66e4c1b01` | Default mTLS listener |
| **Go 1.16** | `2ad2ad0002ad2ad00043d2ad2ad43da5207249a18099be84ef3c8811adc883` | Go binary signature |

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Sliver v1.6+ introduced JARM randomization through cipher suite shuffling. Do not rely solely on JARM for detection.

#### TLS Certificate Patterns

- US city names in certificate chain (e.g., "New Haven", "Atlanta")
- CN=localhost in default certificates
- Self-signed certificates with unusual validity periods

#### HTTP Response Signatures

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (default HTTPS profile)
```

### Endpoint-Based Detection

#### PowerShell Execution Pattern

```
-NoExit -Command [Console]::OutputEncoding=[Text.UTF8Encoding]::UTF8
```

**Sigma Rule**: `42333b2c-b425-441c-b70e-99404a17170f`

#### PsExec Service Creation

| Indicator | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| Service Name | `Sliver` or `Sliver implant` |
| Binary Path | `C:\Windows\Temp\[a-zA-Z0-9]{10}\.exe` |
| EventCode | 7045 (System) |

**Sigma Rule**: `31c51af6-e7aa-4da7-84d4-8f32cc580af2`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Deploy JARM monitoring** for known Sliver fingerprints on egress traffic
2. **Create alerts** for service creation with names matching "Sliver" pattern
3. **Monitor** for PowerShell with `-NoExit -Command [Console]::OutputEncoding` pattern
4. **Hunt** for CreateRemoteThread into spoolsv.exe and notepad.exe

### Detection Engineering

1. **Implement behavioral detection** for process injection sequences
2. **Deploy Sigma rules** from SigmaHQ for Sliver-specific patterns
3. **Add YARA rules** for memory scanning of running processes
4. **Correlate** network connections from unsigned Go binaries

### Strategic Mitigations

1. **Application whitelisting** to prevent unauthorized binary execution
2. **Network segmentation** to limit lateral movement opportunities
3. **Enhanced logging** of PowerShell, service creation, and process injection
4. **Regular threat hunting** for C2 indicators in DNS and HTTPS traffic

## Intelligence Gaps

- Limited visibility into customized Sliver deployments with modified JARM signatures
- Unknown extent of private Sliver forks used by sophisticated actors
- Evolving evasion techniques in newer Sliver versions (post-1.6)
- Full scope of ransomware affiliates utilizing Sliver infrastructure
